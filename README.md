## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This project automates core functionalities of the [OrangeHRM demo site](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) using **Selenium**, **Cucumber (BDD)**, **TestNG**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.  
It covers UI-based creation and deletion of user records, and includes basic REST Assured structure for API automation (commented due to demo site limitations).
