# OrangeHRM Automation Framework  
FlairsTech Assessment Project

## Project Description
This project automates core functionalities of the [OrangeHRM Demo Site](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) using Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber (BDD), TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.  
It also includes API automation examples using Rest Assured for candidate creation and deletion.

Important Note:  
The OrangeHRM public demo site does not fully support API authentication or protected API actions. Therefore, the API automation leverages session cookies obtained after UI login.
